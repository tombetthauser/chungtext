			<h1>Thomas Pu Chung</h1>
			<h3>Everything is Sacred</h3>
			<p>Since before his time as a graduate student at the Yale School of Art, and an undergraduate at the San Francisco Art institute, Tom Chung's paintings, drawings, sculptures, installations, videos and mixed media works have occupied and explored a unique space of overlap between the often disperate worlds of New Age spirituality and fiercely complex identity politics. And although his deep and sincere devotion to these has always been patently clear, he has never treated them with undue simplicity by questioning and critically prodding them at every oppourtunity.</p>
			<p>When I first met the artist in San Francisco, he was painting a mural whose central figure was a life-sized muscle-bound figure with eight radial arms and an elk skull in place of it's head surrounded by a mixture of New Age artifacts and icons. Visiting his studio space sometime thereafter, I would find him working on a number of more personal canvases featuring everything from Lucy Lu posing as a statue of justice, to the artist in Vietnam era combat attire, to a self portrait urinating into a vitamin water bottle while assuming the pose of a magazine cover model. A great deal has changed in the artist's work over the past decade, but not his commitment to exploring the contradictions, shortcomings, strengths and moments of beauty found in Asian American and New Age identity.</p>
			<p>The myriad questions raised in Chung's work constitute an almost singular voice that is painfully lacking in the art world. Perhaps the most powerful of these questions orbit around finding a sincere gateway to spirituality in contemporary mass-media culture, drenched with distracting images of celebrity, scandal and product placement. To this Chung offers no simple answers, but rather a voice of comraderie to others that might find themselves lost in this cultural maelstrom and a reminder that everything is not always simple and not always ok but that there is always strange beauty and sardonic humor hidden just below the surface to help you work through the struggle.</p>

			<h3>Everything is Sacred</h3>
			<p>Over a century has passed since religion was declared dead in the western world by the early proponents of modern psychology, philosophy and observational science. And for longer still the comparitively brief period of popularity regarding visual literalizations of god and religious concepts had given way to the newly born avante guard fine art communities in Europe and the United States. Although these groups largely took a hard stance against overt religious depictions (notable exceptions excluded) an less literal but perhaps much older form of visual spirituality rose to fill the place of old christian narratives and iconography, one with appropriately seemed to mimic an older and more globally pervasive variety.</p>

			<p>My first memories of the artist are against the backdrop of the small but competitive undergraduate painting department at the San Francisco Art Institute in the early 2000's.</p>
