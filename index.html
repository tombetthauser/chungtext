			<h1>Everything is Sacred</h1>
			<h3>(long / personal version)</h3>
				<br>
			<p>
				The first time I saw Tom Chung's work he was in the midst of completing a temporary thirty foot mural at the San Francisco Art institute. It featured a dozen life-sized figures taking the form of everything from muscle-bound hindu and pagan deities to caucasian tabloid celebrities and pop-culture icons. I didn't know what to make of the work, which is to say I couldn't derive an immediate simplistic conclusion from it. This piece, and the majority of Chung's work as it would turn out, challenged me in a way that little else had, even in one of the most traditionally anti-traditional undergraduate art schools in the country. Perhaps more importantly though, the work acknowledged a frustration, a schizophrenia that at the time I felt to be very much related to being in the Western U.S. but that I would later come to realize was more simply related to being American and ultimately human.
			</p><p>
				As I came to better know Chung as a graduate student, my initial interest in his work was compounded by the motivations and personality behind it. Although his work often seemed built on nihilistic sarcasm, he proved to be a fundamentally sincere and deeply spiritual humanist. Although he was an ardent devotee to the pop-culture and off-beat television of the 90's and early 2000's, his relationship and reverence for nature seemed to rival the fervor of a 19th century romantic poet. All this further complicated the experience of trying to understand his work, but amplified the growing suspicion I had that he approached all of it with love and near self-destructive seriousness. Before I knew it I found myself celebrating, defending and promoting his work in the presence of faculty, students and peers both during our time as students and later as we both began passionate teaching careers.
			</p><p>
				Today, when I introduce Chung's work to my students, I contextualize it by suggesting that it might remind us that we live in a world full of seemingly easy but contradictory answers. Where millions of flawed images, defunct celebrities and imperfect products vie for our attention offering to act in place of religion in offering temporary satisfaction and peace. Chung's work attempts to transcend this madness not by offering us false simplicity and not by advocating his personal opinion, but by embracing the contradictions along with the viewer in search of truth, beauty and sardonic humor. Perhaps most importantly, his work seems to be searching for spiritual meaning in the cacophony he presents. Not just in the sublime presence of an arctic wilderness or a south american rainforest, but in the 24-hour news cycle, media trivialisations of world tragedies and the bottomless pits of Netflix and Youtube to which we are all now subject. 
			</p><p>
				Over the past decade watching Chung's work develop I have become more and more convinced that he sincerely loves and hates everything he paints with equal measure. When I look at his work now, after the natural wave of obvious misinterpretations and visceral associations passes, I am always reminded that somewhere inside myself I love and hate all of this too, and that everything both in and outside the confines of the painting is ultimately sacred.

			<h1>Everything is Sacred</h1>
			<h3>(short / less-personal)</h3>
				<br>
			<p>
				Since his time at the San Francisco Art Institute, the Yale School of Art and throughout the early days of his passionate teaching career, Tom Chung has consistently made powerful, provocative and uncompromising work devoted to his sincere and unique perspective on the schizophrenia of contemporary spirituality, race, sexuality, social alienation, pop-culture, visual mass-media and politics. His work of the past decade has freely explored performance, video, large-print photography, installation and sculpture while always maintaining a strong connection to his roots as a painter and draftsman.
			</p><p>
				When one is confronted with the often painful, humorous, legitimately disturbing and seemingly contradictory images Chung presents in his work, a reaction of fascination is just as likely as one of bewilderment or obstinate offense. In this way Chung's work humbly mirrors the effect that the world and media around us naturally have on viewers trying to make sense of it, only presenting it all through a slightly refracted and concentrating lens. What might chiefly distinguish Chung as an artist and as an individual is his desire to embrace rather than hide from the psychological maladies of the society we all share. This embrace has taken him to all corners of the world, from the streets of Hong Kong to the rainforests of South America and to his current residence in America's last frontier state, all the time creating a visible record of his diverse and sometimes mundane transcendental experiences.
			</p><p>
				When we look at Chung's work, after the natural wave of possible misinterpretations and visceral associations pass, we are invited to entertain the notion that the artist might both love and hate everything he is painting, that he might not be trying to offer answers to us but rather trying to ask questions with us. When we sit with the work long enough we might also find access to a deeper layer of spirituality behind the masks presented, reminding us that somewhere inside ourselves we can both love and hate all of this at the same time too, that we don't have to limit ourselves to just one opinion or feeling, and that everything both in and outside the confines of the painting can ultimately be considered valid and sacred.

			<h3>Everything is Sacred</h3>
			<p>Since before his time as a graduate student at the Yale School of Art, and an undergraduate at the San Francisco Art institute, Tom Chung's paintings, drawings, sculptures, installations, videos and mixed media works have occupied and explored a unique space of overlap between the often disperate worlds of New Age spirituality and fiercely complex identity politics. And although his deep and sincere devotion to these has always been patently clear, he has never treated them with undue simplicity by questioning and critically prodding them at every oppourtunity.</p>
			<p>When I first met the artist in San Francisco, he was painting a mural whose central figure was a life-sized muscle-bound figure with eight radial arms and an elk skull in place of it's head surrounded by a mixture of New Age artifacts and icons. Visiting his studio space sometime thereafter, I would find him working on a number of more personal canvases featuring everything from Lucy Lu posing as a statue of justice, to the artist in Vietnam era combat attire, to a self portrait urinating into a vitamin water bottle while assuming the pose of a magazine cover model. A great deal has changed in the artist's work over the past decade, but not his commitment to exploring the contradictions, shortcomings, strengths and moments of beauty found in Asian American and New Age identity.</p>
			<p>The myriad questions raised in Chung's work constitute an almost singular voice that is painfully lacking in the art world. Perhaps the most powerful of these questions orbit around finding a sincere gateway to spirituality in contemporary mass-media culture, drenched with distracting images of celebrity, scandal and product placement. To this Chung offers no simple answers, but rather a voice of comraderie to others that might find themselves lost in this cultural maelstrom and a reminder that everything is not always simple and not always ok but that there is always strange beauty and sardonic humor hidden just below the surface to help you work through the struggle.</p>

			<h3>Everything is Sacred</h3>
			<p>Over a century has passed since religion was declared dead in the western world by the early proponents of modern psychology, philosophy and observational science. And for longer still the comparitively brief period of popularity regarding visual literalizations of god and religious concepts had given way to the newly born avante guard fine art communities in Europe and the United States. Although these groups largely took a hard stance against overt religious depictions (notable exceptions excluded) an less literal but perhaps much older form of visual spirituality rose to fill the place of old christian narratives and iconography, one with appropriately seemed to mimic an older and more globally pervasive variety.</p>
